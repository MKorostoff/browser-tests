	/* our ultimate goal here is to determine the physical size of the device, 
	    so we can then specify different layouts for the different sizes 
	    HOWEVER doing this is somewhat tricky, because: 
	    a) even after the logical "viewport" has been controlled,
	       two devices of the same physical size can have wildly different
	      "px" dimensions because of different densities
	    b) the CSS "inch" metric is _not_ useful for this purpose, as the
	      "CSS inch" is _defined_ as 96 pixels, and so may be very different
	      from what one would measure with a ruler
	   so to determine size with any accuracy, we first need to determine density,
	    either as "dots per inch" (a physical metric, 
	    closer to what a ruler would report than "pixels per inch"), 
	    or as the density ratio of "dots per inch" to "pixels per inch" 
	   then we can go on to determine the size
	   and finally specify loading of the one needed CSS file for that size
